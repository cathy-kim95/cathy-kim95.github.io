Starting from the 2020 Spring, my major goal in my life is getting a B.S. in Computer Science in the Department of Information and Computer Sciences at the University of Hawaii. I chose to pursue a Computer Science major because I was the person who loved being on a computer. I used the computer for my education and also used it to play games. I eventually thought it would be great to learn how a computer works in detail and wanted to learn how to program the materials that I usually use.

Unfortunately, I thought Computer Science would be easier for me. This thought faded away immediately when I attended the ICS211 course because I had to work on my assignment for a tremendous amount of time. However, I thought it was fun because I was learning something by completing the assignments. For instance, I picked up significant materials such as Javascript, algorithms, data structures, and more. 

These days I am attending algorithm and soft engineering courses, and the quality of education even gets harder. It means I have many things left to learn about programming. I will be tasked to do much more projects and learn much more new materials. I am glad that I can learn more about Computer Science before getting a job in this field.
