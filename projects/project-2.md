In my ICS211 course, I was tasked to implement the Postfix and Prefix Calculator to do the math. Professor Moore provided a format of the code, and I had to implement the function which calculates the answer to the pre-fix and post-fix expression which returns it as a Number. My code should return an Integer when doing int math and a Double when doing floating point math.

In this project I learned post-fix and pre-fix calculation, and also the principles of Stack ADT. For instance, we can only access the top of the stack and stack is usually known as LIFO (last in first out). I also gained more experience with Javascript using a stack to store information.
