In my ICS211 course, I was tasked to implement the Postfix and Prefix Calculator to calculate the given expression. Professor Moore provided a format of the code, and our classmates had to implement the code to calculate the answer and returns it as a Number. The main theme of this assignment was using a Stack to keep track of the operands. Our code must return an Integer when it received int math and a Double when it received floating point math.


By doing this assignment, I learned the concepts of post-fix and pre-fix calculation. Furthermore, I was able to learn what is the Stack ADT. For instance, we can only access the top of the stack and stack is usually known as LIFO (last in first out). I gained more experience with Javascript using a stack to store information.
