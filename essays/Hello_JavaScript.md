JavaScript was the first computer language that I encountered when I attend to CS course. Therefore, it is comfortable language than others because it is my primary language. However, I learned various fundamental programming concepts of JavaScript by using a FreeCodeCamp. The basic structures of JavaScript and working with an array, objects, functions, loops, and if/else statements were not a new concept for me. Although, ECMAScript was brand new material that I did not approach before. The features such as let, arrow function in JavaScript, and promises were very new to me.


I think that Javascript is a good programming language from a software engineering perspective. It is because JavaScript makes people easy to adopt a new language through transpilation and polyfill. There are many advantages of doing more computer languages as a software engineer, and this is why I think JavaScript is a good programming language.


In my ICS314 Software Engineering class, our classmates tend to do WODs(workout of the day). We have to set up the timer and work on the code within the prescribed time. This style of learning involved critical thinking because I have to prepare for the assignment, and it tests my programming skills. I do enjoy WODs, but it is stressful on the same hand. However, I bet this strategy will give me a better lesson on how to do the real coding.
