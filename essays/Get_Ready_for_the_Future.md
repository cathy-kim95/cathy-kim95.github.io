## Why RadGrad?

Usually, a fair amount of students struggle with what they want to do after when they graduate. The same goes for me, of course. I decided to major in computer science because I love to spend time on my computer. But the thing is, I did not consider what kind of job or career that I would like to do in my future. Also, as a newbie, I had no clue where to ask and get information about my curiosity. And thankfully, the RadGrad was there for me.

RadGrad provides various opportunities that I can take of. For instance, it suggests a variety of community events, and it helps me to plan my degree program more effectively. These two features are exactly what I wanted from the beginning of my education. I always wanted to join a certain community and develop interaction skills with like-minded students. RadGrad provides me a various of communities that I can join and it makes a lot easier to see what community is the best fit for me.

As an undergraduate student, I think RadGrad is a great tool to use to adjust my planning for my education and career goal. Using the planner and reading the reviews for the course gave me further insight into my degree plan. Moreover, communities that are listed in the RadGrad helps me to find like-minded people.
