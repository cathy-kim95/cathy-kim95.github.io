## Software Engineering


I guarantee that learning Software Engineering is like a snowball. Why is it snowball? It is because the knowledge of programming will get bigger and bigger as you learn Software Engineering. I am a bit scared about the Software Engineering course because it will be a challenging class, but I am excited to roll the snowball.


My interest in learning Software Engineering is fairly simple. Developing programming skills for my future career. Software Engineering will require a variety of skills for programming, and I am ready to adopt the new features of the computer language. Furthermore, I am excited to accomplish a project as a team. I have not worked as a group before, and working as a team is a significant feature of programming.
