## Software Engineering


To tell the truth, I do not know much about software engineering despite I am pursuing computer science. Software engineering is a core course of the computer science major, and yet I do not know much of it. What I know about software engineering is that it is designing and developing a software application that we used in daily life. For instance, mobile applications are part of software engineering. We use it every day, but not knowing how is it works.



## My Interest



In my past classes, I did not have any chance to work as a team. Every assignment was an individual project, and I heard working as a team is a significant feature for the ICS major. My interest in software engineering is developing my programming skills, but also learn how to work as a team to accomplish a goal. I believe learning how to cooperate with others will make me an efficient programmer in my future career.


As I stated above, one of my interests is developing my programming skills. I guarantee software engineering will require a variety of programming skills, and this will build up my skill set of programming. I am excited to learn more features about programming and how the software works throughout the course.
