## Software Engineering


To tell the truth, I do not know much of software engineering despite I am pursuing computer science. Software engineering is a core course of the computer science major, and yet I do not know much of it. What I know about software engineering is that, it is a designing and developing software application that we useed in daily life. For instance, mobile applications is part of the software engineering. We use it everyday, but not knowing how is it works.



## My Interest



In my past classes, I did not have any chance to work as a team. Every assignment was an individual project, and I heard working as a team is significant feature for the ICS major. My interest in software engineering is developing my programming skills, but also learn how to work as a team to accomplish a goal. I believe learn how to cooperate with others will make me a efficient programmer in my future career.


As I stated above, one of my interest is developing my programming skills. I gurantee software engineering will require variety of programming skills and this will build-up my skill set of programming. I am excited to learn more features about the programming and how software works throughout the course.
