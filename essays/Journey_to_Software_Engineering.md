## Software Engineering


I am a computer science major despite I do not know much about software engineering. When I hear about software engineering, I feel a bit anxious about it. It is because I have no clue what I'm going to learn, and it is a core course of the computer science major. The small piece that I know about software engineering is that it is about designing software applications. I was a student who was eager to learn design and develop software, but I had no chance to learn it before. Now is the time for my journey how to design and develop my software.

## My Interest



Like I stated above, I did not have any chance to develop a program. I was assigned to do the assignments in my past courses, and mostly it was just running the code. I learned how to code and what command I should use for a particular case. Therefore, I had a hard time understanding the theoretical part of computer programming. For instance, how it works and why it works. My interest in software engineering is simple. I want to learn how software is working and how to design them.

Besides, I also did not have any chance to work as a team. I heard working as a team is a significant feature of the computer science field. My other interest in the course is to learn how to work as a team to accomplish the goal. Learning to cooperate with others as a teammate will make me an efficient programmer when I jump into the real world. Those are the principal theme that I am looking forward to in the ICS314.
