## Before Using a Semantic UI

My first HTML web page was junk. Literally, a junk. The margins, the paddings, the image size, the alignments were a mess, and I had no clue how to make it beautiful. For instance, if I fix my margins then other elements were getting uglier. What a shame. I had to stop working with my first HTML web page because I no longer want to look ugly page that I made.

## After Using a Semantic UI

Fortunately, and thankfully, there was a helper for me. **UI framework**. I did not have to mess around with my code anymore, because Semantic UI did everything for me. I was amazed when I first used Semantic UI. The most struggling part of HTML was placing the context in the exact place. I had to use margins and paddings to do that, but with UI, I could finish within a few words - class: "ui right item". It automatically places my element on the right side of my web page. It was a beautiful feature, that makes a beautiful web page.

After learning how to use the UI framework, there was no point in using raw HTML and CSS because the UI framework makes life easier. I do not have to spend time making the equal size of sections, menu bar, using an image as background, etc. Additionally, I could not find any problem with using a Semantic UI. The brief explanation and example codes on the [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/) were very helpful. Now I cannot imagine designing a web page without Semantic UI. It is a powerful and wonderful tool to make my ugly page into a beautiful-looking page.
